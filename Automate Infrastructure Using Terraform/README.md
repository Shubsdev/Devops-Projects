Notice that a new directory has been created: .terraform.... This is where Terraform keeps plugins. Generally, it is safe to delete this folder. It just means that you must execute terraform init again, to download them.

Moving on, let us create the only resource we just defined. aws_vpc. But before we do that, we should check to see what terraform intends to create before we tell it to go ahead and create it.

Run terraform plan

Then, if you are happy with changes planned, execute terraform apply
